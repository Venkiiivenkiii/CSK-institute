On this day, people cook a special dish called "Pongal" in a new clay pot, which is made from freshly harvested rice, jaggery (sugarcane), and milk. The dish is cooked outdoors, often in the early morning, in an open space or on rooftops, and is offered to the Sun God, acknowledging the importance of the sun in ensuring a good harvest. The pot is allowed to boil over as a symbol of abundance, and it is traditionally decorated with turmeric leaves and flowers.
